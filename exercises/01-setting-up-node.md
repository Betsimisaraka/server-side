# Exercise 1: Setting up our Node environment

Let's start by initialising a Node project in this repo.

1. `npm init -y`

Now that we have a `package.json` fileâ€¦

2. Let's edit it so we can run a node script that calls a specific JS file. Let's call this script: `serve`. We'll use `node ./index.js` as the basis for the script.

In other words, we want Node.js to run our `index.js` file.

OK, let's run the script!

3. `npm run serve`

What happened?
